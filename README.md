# VALO - Value Ontology of AI Systems

## Overview

This repository contains the code for VALO (Value Ontology of AI Systems), an ontology developed for the systematic analysis of values embedded in the European Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). VALO aims to provide a structured representation of the AIA’s key concepts, including requirements, risks, stakeholders, and the implicit and explicit values promoted by different regulatory aspects.

The ontology was developed following the seven-step methodology for ontology creation proposed by Noy and McGuinness (2021). It enables a transparent and extendable framework for analyzing AI regulations and their adaptability across different jurisdictions.

## Features

- **Systematic Representation:** Captures explicit and implicit values in the AIA.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Designed for future refinements and adaptations.
- **Graph-Based Structure:** Compatible with ontology tools such as Protégé and graph databases for querying and inference.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Enables the evaluation of AI regulatory frameworks, demonstrated through a case study on China’s AI regulation.
